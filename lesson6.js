Who wants to put away dishes when you can program something else to do it.
If we have 5 dishes, do we say....
Put away dish 
Put away dish
Put away dish
Put away dish
Put away dish  
What about if we have 500 dishes to put away?  50,000?
Put the dishes away. Is how we say it... to code it we say something else.....
