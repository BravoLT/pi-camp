# Remote Python Camp Notebooks

## About

The contents of this repository have been extracted from an open-source Python course that utilizes Juypter notebooks, which can be found [here](https://github.com/ehmatthes/intro_programming).  Our intentions are to repurpose these notebooks so that they can be used in a Python programming course that can be taught remotely.  

## Concepts Covered

- Datatypes
- Variables
- If Statements
- Loops
- Lists

## Using Notebooks

Upload your notebooks to a host running Juypter notebooks with Python 3.x installed.  You can also run them locally by doing the following:
- Install Python 3.x to your PC.
- Install Visual Studio Code to your PC.
- Open a notebook in Code and install any extentions reccomended by the editor.

## Todo

The contents of this repository are undergoing active development, and what currently resides in it may not reflect the final product.  At this time, we need to look at each notebook and determine which content should be cut or added.  Addtional workbooks my be required if lessons need to be split or added.
