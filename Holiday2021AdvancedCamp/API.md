# Making remote API calls

Triggering an action on a network takes some kind of agreement between the sender and receiver of a message.  The receiver needs to define a set of commands and the sender needs to send the apropriate command.

This can be performed in multiple ways.  Commonly, this is performed through HTTP calls.  The most common way to make an HTTP call is through a web browser.  We will examine these calls in a web browser and expand the calls in a few ways.
