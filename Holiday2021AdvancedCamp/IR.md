# IR - Making your own universal remote

For this module, we are going to see what is going on behind the scenes when you click a button on a remote control.

From https://wonderopolis.org/wonder/how-does-a-remote-control-work we know that IR signals require line-of-sight to work.  This means that if there is something in the way of the transmitter and receiver, the signal will not get through.

We are going to capture IR signals from a remote control and program into our own 'IR Blaster'.   The IR Blaster will transimit whatever code we want.
