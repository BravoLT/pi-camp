// Lesson 1: Hello World


// Hello World is often the first program a developer
// writes when learning a new language.  in javescript,
// we can write this program by displaying output to the
// console with the console.log function, like so:
console.log("Hello World!");


// A comment is a special line of code that does
// not get run by JavaScript.  They are denoted
// by a special sequnce of characters.

// <-- double forward slashes for single-line comments

/*
For multi-line comments, open the comment by
using a forward slash, then star.

And close then by using star, then forward slash

*/

// This course contains commented out code that you
// will be directed to "uncomment".  Uncommenting
// code simply means to remove the special characters
// that desinate that code as a comment

// For example, the code below become excutiable
// if you remove the /* and */ around it

/*
console.log("I work now");
*/

/*
And the code below will become excutable if you
remove the double slashes (//) in front of it
*/

// console.log("comments have been slashed away");


// Challenge
// Write a message to the console with console.log
